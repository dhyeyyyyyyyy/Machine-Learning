# Repository Description

## Machine Learning Practicals & Career Prediction Model

This repository contains a collection of practical implementations of various machine learning algorithms, including classification, regression, and clustering techniques. It also includes a **Career Prediction Project** that leverages a Random Forest classifier with SMOTE for class balancing, designed to predict suitable career paths based on user input. The repository is structured with well-documented code, datasets, and detailed explanations to facilitate easy understanding and experimentation.
